# App Engine Trebuchet
App Engine Trebuchet is a replacement for the App Engine Launcher.  It's super ultra expiremental, and under active development.  This is a not an official Google project.  

## TODO
- Wait on process up to declare success on starts and pipe the error
- Add create / import experience
- Tests, tests, tests
- Logs search
- Log split/resize control
- Ensure process start failures (path doesn't exist) are piped to Logs
- Implement error reporting system 
- Figure out packaging
- Implement auto-update
- Swap auto-name library for something custom made (and not likely to get me in trouble)
