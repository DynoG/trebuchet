# App Engine Trebuchet
App Engine Trebuchet is a replacement for the App Engine Launcher.  It's super ultra expiremental, and under active development.  This is a not an official Google project.

## TODO
- Wait on process up to declare success on starts and pipe the error
- Add import experience
- Add flex support
- Tests, tests, tests
- Logs search
- Log split/resize control
- Implement error reporting system 
- Figure out packaging
- Implement auto-update
- Swap auto-name library for something custom made (and not likely to get me in trouble)
- auto download gcloud if not available
- figure out gcloud auth login
- combine start/stop on the context menu
- keyboard shortcuts
